This project analyzes the relational database "MauntClassics" to optimize warehouse storage and reduce overstock. The goal is to make data-driven decisions for warehouse closure while maintaining supply chain efficiency.

## Key Insights
- High Sales Products: The majority of stock movement.
- Oversold Items: Inventory tracking improvements are needed.
- Negligible Normal & Overstocked Products: Warehouse space can be optimized.
## Key Takeaways:
  High Sales: The business moves inventory efficiently, but supply chain management needs optimization to prevent stockouts.
  Oversold Products: This is likely due to inaccurate stock tracking or delays in replenishment.
  Normal & Overstocked Products: Minimal impact on storage decisions.

##  Recommendations
1️ **Close an underutilized warehouse** to cut storage costs.  
2️ **Reduce overstocked items** to optimize inventory space.  
3️ **Increase orders for high-sales products** to meet demand.  
  
**1985 Toyota Supra is the product name, quantity is 7733 but not sold product, this product must be sold at a discount or returned to the supplier so that the warehouse is optimized.**

## Preliminary Insights:
-**Oversold Products:**

 These products have demand exceeding supply.
 Possible action: Increase restocking or prioritize sourcing.

-**Overstocked Products:**

 These items have no sales but are in significant stock.
 Possible action: Reduce reorder frequency, offer discounts, or phase out.

-**High Sales Products:**

 These products are performing well in sales.
 Possible action: Keep a close eye on stock levels to avoid running out.

**Normal Stock:**
 These products have a balance between sales and inventory.
 Possible action: No immediate action is required, but monitor trends.
