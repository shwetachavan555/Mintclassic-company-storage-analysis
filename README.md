# Inventory Analysis - MauntClassics

## Overview
This project analyzes inventory data to optimize warehouse storage and reduce overstock. The goal is to make data-driven decisions for warehouse closure while maintaining supply chain efficiency.

## Key Insights
- **High Sales Products**: The majority of stock movement.
- **Oversold Items**: Inventory tracking improvements needed.
- **Negligible Normal & Overstocked Products**: Warehouse space can be optimized.
# Key Takeaways:
 # High Sales: The business moves inventory efficiently, but supply chain management needs optimization to prevent stockouts.
 # Oversold Products: This is likely due to inaccurate stock tracking or delays in replenishment.
 # Normal & Overstocked Products: Minimal impact on storage decisions.
## Data
- `inventory_data.csv`: Raw inventory and sales data.
- `analysis_results.csv`: Categorized inventory insights.

## SQL Queries
- `inventory_analysis.sql`: Identifies oversold, high sales, and overstocked products.
- `warehouse_optimization.sql`: Helps evaluate storage facility closure.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Database analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization.
- **Python (Optional)**: Data processing.

## Recommendations:
**Prioritize Stock Accuracy**

**Implement real-time inventory tracking to avoid overselling.**
**Improve forecasting based on sales trends.**
**Optimize Warehousing**

Since overstocked products are minimal, warehouse space could be restructured instead of fully closing a facility.
Focus on optimizing storage for high-selling products.
Supplier & Order Management
Strengthen supplier relationships for faster restocking of high-sales items.
