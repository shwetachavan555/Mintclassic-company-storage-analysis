# Inventory Analysis - MauntClassics

## Overview
This project analyzes inventory data to optimize warehouse storage and reduce overstock. The goal is to make data-driven decisions for warehouse closure while maintaining supply chain efficiency.

# Key Insights
- High Sales Products: The majority of stock movement.
- Oversold Items: Inventory tracking improvements needed.
  Negligible Normal & Overstocked Products: Warehouse space can be optimized.
# Key Takeaways:
  High Sales: The business moves inventory efficiently, but supply chain management needs optimization to prevent stockouts.
  Oversold Products: This is likely due to inaccurate stock tracking or delays in replenishment.
  Normal & Overstocked Products: Minimal impact on storage decisions.
## Data
- `mauntclassica.sql`: Raw inventory and sales data.
- `oversold, high sales, normal stock.csv`: Categorized inventory insights.
- 'low stock high sale product.csv':Categorized inventory insights.
- 'oversold.csv':Categorized inventory insights.
## SQL Queries
- `mauntclassica.sql`: Identifies oversold, high sales, and overstocked products.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Database analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization.
- **Python (Optional)**: Data processing.

## Recommendations:
Prioritize Stock Accuracy
Implement real-time inventory tracking to avoid overselling.
Improve forecasting based on sales trends.
Optimize Warehousing

Since overstocked products are minimal, warehouse space could be restructured instead of fully closing a facility.
Focus on optimizing storage for high-selling products.
Supplier & Order Management
Strengthen supplier relationships for faster restocking of high-sales items.
Automate reorder levels for in-demand products
